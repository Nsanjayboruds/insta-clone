## Styling notes & customization

* The CSS uses variables at the top of `style.css` (colors, spacing, breakpoints) â€” change them to re-theme the page quickly.
* Grid layout for posts is implemented with `display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(220px, 1fr));` for responsive behaviour.
* Profile action buttons use subtle hover states created with `:hover` and CSS transitions.

---

## Accessibility

* Semantic elements (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `aside`, `footer`) are used for better structure.
* Images include `alt` attributes. If you add decorative images, mark them with empty `alt=""`.
* Ensure color contrast when customizing theme variables.
